# Simple-JavaScript-Quiz

A simple 5 Question quiz built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

This begins with building the basic HTML page, outlining the format, the questions and answers.
Next, I styled the page using CSS and making sure that it is responsive. 
Finally I added the logic using JavaScript to get the user input, adding validation, setting the correct answers, checking users answers, and displaying the results.
